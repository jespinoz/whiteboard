whiteboard
==========

This is a simple collaborative online whiteboard application that demonstrates the Java API for WebSocket (JSR 356). It uses 
very basic JavaScript/HTML 5 code on the client side. Make sure to use two browser sessions or different browsers to see the full effects
of WebSocket based bi-directional communication.

The application runs on GlassFish 4, but any Java EE 7 application server should work.
